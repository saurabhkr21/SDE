            "I have been using this for about six months now. It is quite handy and is able to make pretty good fruit shakes and smoothies. I add a couple of ice cubes and it manages to crush them, but needs more than one cycle. Battery life is acceptable, I charge after every 5-6 uses. The motor runs at full all the time, I thought that I would be able to tell when the battery gets low but no, it will simply stop at the last second with no way to tell if it is getting low. Initially I wondered if the exposed charging port would lead to any problems or not, but I have been careful with it and have had no issues.I find it to be a great and useful product for one person. Get a proper non-portable blender if you want to use it for blending hard, dry substances, or for multiple people.,Easy to use,Best Blender used so far,Great product. Very compact and easy to carry. Can‚Äôt blend hard items but works for soft fruit smoothies or milkshakes. We liked this product,Build is solid. And the motor is powerful enough for its purpose. It would have been perfect if the charging port was not exposed.,Good oneSatisfied,I am using this product since 2weeks.It is good upto now. I am using this for only milk shake with banana only.its blending is good,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61yaKvhqNSL._SY88.jpg",

            "Good fit, nice smart watch in this price range, especially for  those who need only basic features . I bought grey color,It's been long I'm using this now. It has no issues. The battery, touch screen, bluetooth connection every thing works fine. I was looking for something simple and I got this.,Nice design and functionsCan't connect to Whatsapp and other social media app üëé,The modes in the watch are good. The UI sucks. Responsiveness could have been better. Battery life is moderately upto 3-4 days if worn constantly. Colour of the band is a bit faded too.,Activity Record, sleep tracking is Good.,Good product,I bought it for my wife and she was very glad.,Good",

        review_content:
            "I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.  Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it's a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good",

Packaging like no value for money box is band from corner,I found the start-up of the SSD slower , like if u turn on a pc the first thing that kicks in motherboard then GPU/ cup and right after that the SSD in this case i found the SSD took about 2 seconds and a delayed response to startup ,but when ever it didn't start it was quick , don't know probably an issue with my psu or something,Hands down, Go for it.Quite nice, sleek design.Build material is plastic.But one thing I found odd is that the HDD cover that when I put on it and when applied screws then the screws was very hard to put. Last holes were a little misaligned. But after a little bit of force it fits.,Bought this product in Nov 2022. Easy to install and the performance is good.,I installed into my 12yr old desktop, now my i3-540 is showing it's level best. Compared to my old HDD, it's superb to use.Go for it without any second thought.One suggestion, if just buying to boost performance and for desktop, go for 240GB version to keep the OS and keep the existing HDD as well attached as extended internal drive.,Used to upgrade the speed and performance of my old laptop. Works as expected,At first i would like to suggest to look for the rating of the seller selling electronic products, before ordering this i ordered a similiar product crucial ssd500gb but instead i got a toshiba hdd of 500 gb that too loaded with photo and word document of some guy. I contacted amazon and they refunded me right away. Then i placed this order after searching for rating of this seller, which i found legit.. The SSD is good, i installed it in my asus laptop, the laptop is running with 10gigs of ram, i3 gen8 processor, and this ssd, after installing it boot up within 20-30seconds, whereas my previous hdd takes nearly about 3-5minutes.",

            "Perfect for room heating ..... Noiseless,,Silent instant heating within 30 seconds. Easy to carry just a small suggestion that it should have left and right wind blower also instead of only up and down. Best product not saying it in this range but I have used others also this is the best till date. Even some time we use it as heat massager also as wind flow is awesome so sometime for back pain or knees it's a perfect product. Anyone of buying for the first time or buying for a better experience will recommend to go for this. Its almost 60 days of usage now. And yes easy to clean also. I have a dog and she also enjoys it...,I got a 15 month old used heater, not a new one.The fan is making a too much noise. It is a defective or a damaged piece.I got it on 18th Dec 2022. When I try to request a replacement I am told the return window is closed.If Amazon / Seller is sending a 15 month old used defective product should they at least not have the responsibility to at least get it replaced.,I have been using ptc heaters for a few years now and have been happy with their performance and longevity(usha & orpat).So decided to buy one more this year - saw this one had the highest rating. Bought it. Saw that its basically made by bajaj.Anyway, its good looking and all seemed fine. But i started noticing a flaw with the thermostat. Normally, there is always a hysteresis in the thermostat dial - it turns on at one point and turns off a little further back. But this one was turning On and OFF at exactly the same point. Then i started observing that if the thermostat was on , it simply remained on. If it was off, it remained off. Tried it multiple times and realised that the thermostat doesnt work. So finally returned it.Overall power consumption is as expected - around 1.4KW at low and 2KW at high.,Good,Very nice product.....,good for a room of small size upto 150 sqft, warms rooms within an hour and takes about 2 for a room of 200 sqft. its really light weight and silent in operation. has different settings for fan speed and hot/cold air. the only drawback is that it wont work for a big room or hall area.  overall a good product .",

            "The product is very good. Keya are ergonomic. After using it for 2 months, the keys are starting to get hard.. let's see how it performs in the future,For daily use value for money normal typing is good spacebar key is not properly pressed overall good to buy cheap product,I mean it is not a bad keyboard but i can get the same keyboard at local store for cheap price without paying for delivery so please consider this before buying.,After using standard boards like Logitech this seems to be with narrow gap between keys.  I have to adjust myself and careful not pressing two keys.  But it is smooth and without noise.  May be useful for beginners.  very economical,Good keyboard at affordable price,Good product at this budget but not good for gaming, very basic keyboard,for typing purposes its waste of money rather go for a mechanical keyboard,Nice",
